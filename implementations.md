### picoquic / fuzi_q

Picoquic is a small(ish) implementation of QUIC in C, to explore the protocol
and the API, for example for DNS over QUIC. Relies on PicoTLS for TLS 1.3. MIT
license. Tested on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD/IOS.

Over the net fuzzing of QUIC servers or clients. Fuzi_q can be used as a client
to test a QUIC server, or as a server to test a QUIC client.

Fuzi_q started from the testsuite of picoquic. Fuzi_q hooks into the Picoquic
stack, catching messages just before they would be encrypted and fuzzing them.
It tries to do that intelligently. For each connection, Fuzi_q determines an
encryption point, such as "the initial messages ave been processed", or "the
handshake is confirmed", or "the connection is closing". The connection
progresses up to that state, and then packets are fuzzed. The fuzzing itself is
based on knowledge of the QUIC protocol. The fuzzer might modify QUIC frames, or
insert randomly chosen QUIC frames in the packets. The procedures implemented in
the initial version are simple, there is clearly room for more sophistication.
Suggestions are welcome.
