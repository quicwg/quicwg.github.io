title: QUIC Working Group - How to Contribute
---

**Be aware that all contributions fall under the "[NOTE WELL](#note-well)" terms
outlined below and our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) applies.**

# Engaging with the QUIC community

The scope of work in the QUIC Working Group is described in our
[charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/about/). Anyone is welcome to
contribute to the QUIC Working Group; you don't have to join the Working Group,
because there is no "membership" -- anyone who participates in the work **is** a
part of the QUIC Working Group.

Before doing so, please familiarize yourself with our
[charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/about/). If you're new to IETF
work, you may also want to read the [Getting
Started](https://www.ietf.org/participate/get-started/) page and the many
resources it links to.

## Following Discussion

The Working Group has a few venues for discussion:

* [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/) - Agendas, minutes, and presentations are available in our [meeting
  materials repository](https://github.com/quicwg/wg-materials) and the
  [official proceedings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/meetings/).

* Our [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic) is used for
  communication such as notifications of meetings, new drafts, consensus calls
  and other business, as well as issue discussion.

* We maintain several repositories in our GitHub organization
  [Github](https://github.com/quicwg/). Specific issues are discussed on the
  relevant issues list. If you don't want to use Github to follow these
  discussions, you can subscribe to the [issue announce
  list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic-issues).

* The [quicdev Slack](https://quicdev.slack.com/) is used for more realtime
  communication, typcially amongst implementers, operators and researchers.
  Contact the [WG chairs](quic-chairs@ietf.org) for an invitation. Note that
  discussions on Slack are subject to the contribution guideline described in
  this document.

To be active in the Working Group, you can participate in any of these places.
Whether you prefer mailing list, GitHub or Slack, the community helps ensure the
topics reach the right people in all places.

## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies
to all Working Group communications and meetings.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) intended by the Contributor for publication as
all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or RFC and any statement made within the context of an IETF
activity is considered an "IETF Contribution". Such statements include oral statements in IETF
sessions, as well as written and electronic communications made at any time or place, which are
addressed to:

 * The IETF plenary session
 * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG
 * Any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working group
   or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF auspices
 * Any IETF working group or portion thereof
 * Any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session
 * The IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB
 * The RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function
 * All IETF Contributions are subject to the rules of
   [RFC 5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and
   [RFC 8179](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8179).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function, that are clearly not
intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or function, are not IETF Contributions in the
context of this notice.

Please consult [RFC 5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and [RFC 8179](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8179) for details.

A participant in any IETF activity is deemed to accept all IETF rules of process, as documented in
Best Current Practices RFCs and IESG Statements.

A participant in any IETF activity acknowledges that written, audio and video records of meetings
may be made and may be available to the public.
