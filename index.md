## Implementing QUIC

There are a range of [implementations](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations). Some focus on providing features of the core protocol, while some also include support for in-progress extensions.

Implementers should join the [quicdev Slack](https://quicdev.slack.com/) to coordinate testing; contact the [WG chairs](mailto:quic-chairs@ietf.org) for an invitation. Note that discussions on Slack are considered IETF contributions under "Note Well".

[Automated, continuous interop testing](https://interop.seemann.io/) is performed for participating QUIC implementations. Implementers are encouraged to join this effort by making [compatible Docker images](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner#building-a-quic-endpoint) of their implementations available.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you believe you've discovered a vulnerability in the QUIC protocol (or related
IETF protocols) please see the IETF's guidance on [how to report
these](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/vulnerabilities/).

If you believe you've discovered an implementation vulnerability in a product,
open source project, or service using QUIC, then you should report these
directly to the responsible party. The IETF does not have a formal means to reach
these parties and cannot do so on your behalf. Implementers or operators often
provide their own publicly-available disclosure documents that provide contact
details and guidelines for reporters. The
[implementations](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations)
wiki may include a link to such documents under the "Vulnerability reporting"
field.
